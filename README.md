# Taj Mahal : A Monument of Love ❤️🏛️

A digital monument created to celebrate **endless love**.

_The hardest things to express are love and infinity. So I coded them both. ❤️_

This interactive 3D web experience features a sculpted Taj Mahal in an infinite, starlit space, personalized with your loved one's name. Inspired by the dedication Shah Jahan to Mumtaz Mahal, this project is a modern, digital testament to your devotion.

## 🛠️ How to Customize It

You can easily personalize this monument for your own love story by making small changes in the main script file.

### 💖 1. Change the Name

1. First of all inside the index.html file search for any name with Pooja and replace it with your own.

1. Open the main Script file (`script.js`).
1. Near the top of the file, locate the default name (`Pooja`) and replace it with the name you wish to use.

✅ **Result:** The sculpted name and the personalized quotes will automatically update to reflect the new name.

---

### 💞 2. Add or Remove Quotes

The project includes a collection of 40 quotes, but you can tailor them to your own relationship:

1.  In `script.js`, find the `const quotes = [\`...\`]` array.
2.  Remove any quotes you don't like or add your own custom messages to the array.
